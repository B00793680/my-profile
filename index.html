					<p>
						I am a 1st year student at ESSEC Business School ! I grew up in France but I am also English, with some Ukrainian roots. I have one big sister, Agathe, currently studying biotechnologies in engineering school. Throughout my studies in ESSEC, I have had the chance to become the President of HeForShe, which is a feminist association fighting for gender equality on campus !

				<h2><strong>Cooking</strong></h2>

				<h2><strong>Sports</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I am really into sports aswell, and attend volleyball practice as well as the <strong>gym at least 3 times a week!</strong> It's a good way to release stress, and push myself.

				<h2><strong>Public Speaking</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Lastly, one of my passions is public speaking. While I am still very stressed when I am about to deliver my speeches, joining <strong>ESSEC's public speaking association Plaidessec</strong> really helped me overcome my fear and improve my writing style.
